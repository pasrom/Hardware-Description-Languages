#   FHV-Latex template

To use this template, it is recommened to work with 
[TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net). 
You can use the given profile provided in 
[scripts](https://github.com/pasrom/FHV-Latex/tree/master/scripts) 
(Mac, Windows, Linux is not supported yet, but should be same as Mac). 

The bibliography uses Biber to build and is adapted to FHV guidelines.

I also recommend to use 
[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) Latex distribution. 

[Here](https://github.com/pasrom/FHV-Latex/blob/master/tex/Examples.tex) you find some examples: how to use Pictures, Tables, TikZ and the usage of referencing equations/sections.

With the command \Zusammenfassung in
[LatexVorlage.tex](https://github.com/pasrom/FHV-Latex/blob/master/LatexVorlage.tex) you can choose between a summary or thesis. The summary has a wider layout in comparison with the thesis type.

An easy to use 
[tablegenerator.](http://www.tablesgenerator.com).
